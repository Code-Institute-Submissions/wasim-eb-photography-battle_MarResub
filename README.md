## Testing

* I experimented with the webpage on different browsers such as: Chrome(main), firefox, and safari. 
* I also tested the webpage on the [Responsive Design](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) platform. 
* I made sure to test it live on different mobile phones aswell to see if how responsive the website is, also how it would look on different screens.
* I confirmed that the website works in function and in looks.


## Bugs

* I experienced a problem when attempting to view my webpage live. Some pictures were not showing. I corrected this error by adding a dot in the img code:

Before:

After:

* The sign up form was visible at the center of the big image while viewing it on my laptop, but it was moved to the left while viewing it on my mobile phone.
* I fixed this by playing around the margin and padding codes. I am still struggling a little bit with this part in coding but I'm getting there.


## Validator testing

* The end result shows no errors in the HTML code. Check the results here: [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwasim-eb.github.io%2Fphotography-battle%2F)
* The CSS code is is also validated. Check the results here: [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwasim-eb.github.io%2Fphotography-battle%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=es)
* No errors were found neither in the HTML nor the CSS code.

### Coding content
* Most of my coding was used by myself.
* The idea behind the webpage was inspired by a photographer name Northborders on instagram.
* I took a lot of inspiration from the Love Running project.
* I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) as my main source for codes.
* I had to go back a few times and look at older coding from the previous lessons.
